###### Phase 2:
We currently have a fully working **'BLOCKCHAIN'**, this has been built using [JavaScript]() & [TypeScript]() and currently mines, through
actions of the user (API BASED). We are currently working on the implementation of our 'UM続' Blocks, which help form the **CUBE**.

##### What is 'UM続'?
UM続 is a User Module that is created when a user signs up to the platform. This module is then used to create a **'BLOCK'** that is
then added to the **'BLOCKCHAIN'**. This is the first step in creating the **'CUBE'**. UM続 is also a single coin, with 13 Billion in reserve for the populous.

More details coming soon...
